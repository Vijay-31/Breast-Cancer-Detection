# Breast-Cancer-Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient having breast cancer based on certain features. The model has been trained using a breast cancer dataset which contains multiple parameters  and employs different Classification analysis to make predictions and find best results based on those analysis.


# Model Architecture

The model is a classification model based on the different classification algorithms. It uses the scikit-learn library to perform the classification analysis, and the model has been optimized using cross-validation to improve its accuracy.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is provided by University of Southern Indiana, which conducted the study on this topic  to find risk of Breast cancer in women based on 30+ parameters. 

# Result

Logistic Regression Provided best accuracy at 0.9824561403508771 followed by SVM classification at 0.9766081871345029 
while Naive Bayes had least accuracy among datasets at 0.9122807017543859
