# Breast-Cancer-Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient having breast cancer based on certain features. The model has been trained using a breast cancer dataset which contains multiple parameters  and employs different regression analysis to make predictions and find best results based on those analysis.


# Model Architecture

The model is a regression model based on the different regression algorithms. It uses the scikit-learn library to perform the regression analysis, and the model has been optimized using cross-validation to improve its accuracy.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is provided by University of Southern Indiana, which conducted the study on this topic  to find risk of Breast cancer in women based on 30+ parameters.
