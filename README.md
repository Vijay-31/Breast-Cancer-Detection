# Breast-Cancer-Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient having breast cancer based on certain features. The model has been trained using a breast cancer dataset which contains multiple parameters  and employs different regression analysis to make predictions and find best results based on those analysis.


# Model Architecture

The model is a regression model based on the different regression algorithms. It uses the scikit-learn library to perform the regression analysis, and the model has been optimized using cross-validation to improve its accuracy.
